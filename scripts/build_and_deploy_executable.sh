# Note: target architecture defined in Cross.toml (see https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/wiki/Configuration#buildenv)
# If run for the first time, it might also be needed to add it to rustup: `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
# Note also that debug/release configuration loads the corresponding settings in Rocket.toml (e.g. ip address). This is not cross specific.

# Debug version for quicker builds. If using this, the path to the binary in deploy_executable.sh has to be adjusted.

# Release version
cross build -vv --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
